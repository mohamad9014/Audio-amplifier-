# Audio-amplifier-
AB class,audio amplifier with 5 W load power, efficiency 80%
A two stage amplifier
OP-176 and  AB class amplifier are used in first and second stages , respectively.
this amplifier consumes 14 W power with speaker load 8 ohm,suply source ±9 V , maximum gain 63.2 db ,and output voltage  swing ± 6.79
# How to design cicruit :
We design R1 and R2 currents so that the maximum voltage and current reach the load without distortion
It amplifies the voltage by means of a non-inverter amplifier in first stage and It is an AB amplifier that amplifies the current and gives it to the speaker or load.
The output value is almost zero because of the diodes and the amp.In this circuit, Negative voltage-voltage feedback is used.Darlington transistors are used in this circuit because the current we get from resistors R1 and R2 is low. And if we use power transistors because they have small β, they increase the current in the resistors.
